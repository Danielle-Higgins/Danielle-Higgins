### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Danielle and I'm from the US. Iâ€™m a Computer Science graduate passionate about Software Engineering. I really enjoy learning about the web and how different pieces of software work. I like keeping up with the different tech stacks that are out there and I love building fully responsive Full-Stack Web Applications. My journey began with a love for video games and watching my father fix computers, sparking my curiosity in software. I thrive on continuous learning and tackling new challenges!
